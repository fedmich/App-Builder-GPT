# App-Builder-GPT

Use this app to bundle the codes the you get from ChatGPT.
Just paste in the html from chatGPT and click download to get a ZIP of all those codes.

For now, I'm using a web-based builder because I have xampp on this machine.
But we can build it to handle different backend later.
I picked localhost, so the codes won't leave your local machine.
